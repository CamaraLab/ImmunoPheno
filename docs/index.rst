ImmunoPheno: a data-driven platform for the design and analysis of immunophenotyping experiments
================================================================================================

ImmunoPheno is a data-driven bioinformatics platform designed to facilitate the design and analysis of 
immunophenotyping experiments. It addresses the limitations of current cytometry
techniques by enabling researchers to design optimized antibody panels for specific cell populations 
and to more accurately identify and annotate cells in multiplexed antibody-based 
cytometry data. By leveraging single-cell proteotranscriptomic atlases (e.g., CITE-seq), ImmunoPheno enhances the phenotypic resolution,
annotation, accuracy, and reproducibility in immunophenotyping workflows.
