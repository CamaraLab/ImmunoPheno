ImmunoPheno is a Python library for the transcriptome-guided annotation and analysis of cytometry data. It implements functionalities for normalizing cytometry data (including proteotranscriptomic data such as CITE-seq data), establishing reference antigenic profiles and optimal antibody panels based on single-cell proteotranscriptomic data, and identifying and annotating cell populations in multiplexed antibody-based cytometry experiments.
